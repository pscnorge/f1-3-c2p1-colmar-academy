Known issues:

This is a partially-completed project, I didn't have enough time to complete it properly - the design is definitely not pixel-perfect.

Design decisions:

Set max-widths for the content but have not tested it on larger screens
Used dummy links for all nav as content does not yet exist

Changes or further research I would make which are outside the scope of the project:

More breakpoints - e.g. for larger screens and tablets (the navigation in particular doesn't work well at tablet sizes)
Colour - I stuck to a grey palette in this instance
Responsive design best practice - I'm not sure that the way I organised the CSS, with default styling applied and then a breakpoint for mobile, is current best practice. I would like to explore more about this.
Cross-browser check; experiment with CSS Reset
